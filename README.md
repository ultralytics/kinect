# Introduction üåü

Welcome to the [Ultralytics Kinect](https://github.com/ultralytics/kinect) repository! Here, you'll explore state-of-the-art 3D scene reconstruction algorithms using data captured with the Microsoft Kinect sensor, a groundbreaking depth-imaging device. Dive into our technology and watch it in action through example videos on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/ultralytics).
